Unlike European regulations which require that the type of caramel used by manufacturers be indicated on product labels, the US FDA (Food and Drug Administration) and Health Canada make no distinction between them: the same term is used to describe any class.\\10\\10The 4 classes of caramel coloring differ in their method of manufacture and composition:\\10 \\101. Caramel Color I (also called plain caramel, caustic caramel or E150a in Europe); this class is prepared by heating carbohydrates with or without acids or alkalis. Plain caramel is not harmful to human health.\\10 \\102. Caramel Color II (also called caustic sulfite caramel or E150b); this class is prepared by the controlled heat treatment of carbohydrates in the presence of sulfite compounds. Sulfites can cause allergies or intolerance reactions in some individuals.\\10 \\103. Caramel Color III (also called ammonia caramel or E150c); this class is prepared by the controlled heat treatment of carbohydrates with ammonium compounds. During the manufacturing process, two problematic compounds are formed which can be found in trace amounts in caramel at the conclusion of the production process:\\10 \\10• 4-MEI (4-methylimidazole): it has been classified as “possibly carcinogenic to humans” (group 2B) by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and listed as a carcinogen by California’s Proposition 65 law “Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986” (OEHHA, 2011). As a result, any product sold in California that contains 4-MEI concentrations corresponding to exposures that pose excess cancer risks (1 case per 100,000 exposed persons) and is set at 29 μg 4-MEI/day, has to carry a warning label. The FDA is currently reviewing all available data on the safety of 4-MEI to determine what, if any, regulatory action needs to be taken.\\10 \\10• THI (2-Acetyl-4(5)-tetrahydroxybutylimidazole): this component can be toxic to the immune system.\\10 \\104. Caramel Color IV (also called sulfite ammonia caramel or E150d); this class is prepared by heating carbohydrates with ammonium-containing and sulfite-containing compounds. During the manufacturing process, compounds suspected to be carcinogenic (4-MEI) are formed. Residue of this compound can be found in caramel at the end of the production process. Moreover, sulfites are used in the production of this color additive which may trigger allergies or intolerance reactions in some individuals.\\10 \\10Class III and Class IV caramel coloring are the most commonly used food color additives by volume.\\10 \\10“There is no requirement in FDA’s regulations that the ingredient statement on the label of foods that contain Class III or Class IV caramel coloring list the color additive by name or type. It is therefore not possible, unless voluntarily disclosed, to know based on the label if a food contains Class III or IV caramel coloring “confirms the FDA."

The risk associated with titanium dioxide is due in large part to the presence of these nanoparticles.\\10\\10Since 2013, European regulations have required manufacturers to add a \\\"nanomaterials\\\" label if over 50% of total particles are smaller than 100 nanometers. This means that the packaging for a food product containing E171 with 49% of particles being smaller than 100 nm will not carry the \\\"nanomaterials\\\" label. According to a 2016 literature review by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the proportion of nanoparticles in titanium dioxide may vary between 0% and 39% in a number of food products currently sold in Europe.\\10\\10Titanium dioxide was categorized as potentially carcinogenic in humans by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) in 2006 regarding respiratory/pulmonary exposure. In 2017, the European Agency for Chemical Products (ECHA) categorized titanium dioxide as suspected of causing cancer in humans via inhalation.\\10\\10A 2017 study conducted on rats by France\\'s National Institute for Agricultural Research (INRA) demonstrated that E171 has an adverse impact on the intestinal barrier and suggested an effect on cancer development. \\10\\10Following that study, the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety (ANSES) also conducted an evaluation of E171. ANSES notes that the study in question reveals effects that had not been identified previously, in particular regarding E171\\'s potential effects on cancer development. However, it concludes that these results do not, at this stage, justify a reconsideration of the E171 evaluation made by the EFSA in 2016, which found that current E171 exposure is insufficient to result in risks to health. The EFSA specifically noted an absence of data on E171 and called for reproductive toxicity and genotoxicity studies. ANSES also emphasized the need for additional studies.\\10\\10Given the potential risks associated with E171, the European Union has decided to ban titanium dioxide as a food additive from 2022, after its safety was questioned by EFSA, which considered that it could no longer considered « safe »."

The EFSA also recommends that the exact quantity of sulfites be shown on food packaging, in addition to the \\\"contains sulfites\\\" label."

Some pig studies have demonstrated a link between the ingestion of degraded carrageenans and the presence of inflammation or even ulcers in the colon. However, more recent studies performed on rats showed no effect on the development of colon cancer. Indeed, studies do not always specify what types of carrageenans are used, as a chemical distinction is not made between native and degraded carrageenans. As a result, chemical characterization is a prerequisite for a proper interpretation of experiment results. \\10\\10In its 2018 evaluation, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) acknowledges studies indicating that these degraded carrageenans have negative impacts on human health, but it specifies that this type of carrageenan as such is not authorized for use in the European Union as an additive.\\10\\10Regarding native carrageenans, in 2018 the EFSA deemed that this additive does not pose any cancer risk to humans in the maximum authorized doses. However, the EFSA finds that some populations are exposed to native carrageenans in quantities 10 times the current ADI (Acceptable Daily Intake), which poses a health risk. The EFSA thus considers the established ADI to be temporary and points to the need for further studies on this additive within 5 years of the re-evaluation date; the next opinion is therefore planned for release in 2023."

Therefore, it contributes to the total dietary intake of aluminum, which is too high for a large part of the population, according to the 2008 scientific opinion of the EFSA (European Food Safety Authority). \\10\\10Once it is in our bodies, most aluminum is rapidly eliminated via the feces. However, a small portion can then be taken up in the bloodstream and transported into the various tissues of the body, particularly the bones (possibility of accumulation), liver, lungs, kidneys, and brain.\\10\\10Therefore, it can cause serious health problems:\\10- First, it could significantly potentiate oxidative stress. This can induce the amplification and progression of chronic inflammation in many diseases like multiple sclerosis, Crohn\\'s disease, asthma, autism, infertility, and epilepsy.\\10- Aluminum could also deposit in the brain cells and impair cerebral function. It has therefore been implicated in Alzheimer\\'s disease and several other neurological conditions.\\10- Aluminum is a known mutagen, that is, an agent capable of inducing changes in the structure of genetic material.\\10- It has also been found to adversely affect fetal development.\\10\\10This additive also contains phosphorus, a chemical element essential for many biological processes. Notably, phosphorus is involved in most biochemical reactions in the body, as well as in bone mineral density; this is why there is a recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for phosphorus. Phosphorus is naturally found in animal- and vegetable-based products.\\10\\10However, the current actual intakes of phosphorus greatly exceed the recommended allowance for this mineral. In fact, according to the scientific opinion of the EFSA (European Food Safety Authority) delivered in 2015, our intake is 2 to 3 times greater than our requirements due to the presence of phosphate additives in our diet and high consumption of meat and dairy products. Therefore, as concluded by the EFSA in 2019, our actual exposure exceeds the proposed ADI (acceptable daily intake) for phosphates expressed in the quantity of phosphorus. In its scientific opinion delivered in 2016, the ARS (Agricultural Research Service) in the United States also concluded that phosphorous intakes are above the recommended amounts.\\10\\10An excess of phosphorus can lead to serious consequences. It may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease by causing calcification of the blood vessels; in fact, a high phosphorus intake has been linked to increased mortality from cardiovascular disease. Excessive phosphorus intake could also disrupt calcium metabolism and bone mineralization. Finally, a high intake of the mineral is harmful to the kidneys, which are responsible for the elimination of extra phosphorus. As a result, people with kidney disease should pay particular attention to their phosphorus intake."

        "__text": "Monosodium glutamate (MSG) is a flavor enhancer used in many products to intensify flavors. MSG provides umami, often called the fifth basic taste.\\10\\10It is found in many industrial food products, such as potato chips, cookies, soups, preserves, etc. It can also be found in Asian dishes, such as nems, fried rice, and soy sauce. However, it is prohibited in organic products.\\10\\10Monosodium glutamate has long been blamed for \\\"Chinese restaurant syndrome.\\\" That term is now obsolete, having been replaced by the term \\\"MSG symptom complex,\\\" which includes the symptoms experienced by some individuals after a meal in a Chinese restaurant, which may be caused by the frequent use of MSG in Chinese cooking. These symptoms include nausea and vomiting, migraine, skin flushing, a burning sensation, hot flashes, etc. Indeed, a number of studies have demonstrated that presence of some of these symptoms in a subset of participants when exposed to a high dose of MSG. The mechanism behind this cluster of symptoms, however, remains unknown.\\10\\10Moreover, MSG is believed to stimulate appetite, thus increasing the quantity of food ingested. It may therefore promote weight gain and obesity. Several studies (particularly on mice and rats) have thus shown that the use of high doses of monosodium glutamate leads to increased body weight and body fat. Human studies have also shown a positive link between MSG consumption and weight gain. Indeed, glutamate may trigger resistance to leptin, the satiety hormone.\\10\\10Monosodium glutamate may also contribute to diabetes risk. Indeed, several studies have shown that monosodium glutamate leads to a spike in insulin (the hormone secreted by the pancreas to lower blood sugar). Hyperinsulinemia has been demonstrated in a number of studies. Some studies suggest that monosodium glutamate may contribute to the development of diabetes (types 1 and 2).\\10\\10Finally, monosodium glutamate is believed to play a role in the development of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer\\'s disease and Parkinson\\'s disease, as well as autoimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis. A high concentration of glutamate is in fact responsible for the destruction of neurons through a process called excitotoxicity. Monosodium glutamate consumption also affects the operation of leptin, which plays a role in cerebral functions such as learning and memory. Through its effect on leptin, then, monosodium glutamate may also play a role in neurodegenerative disorders.\\10\\10In 2017, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re-evaluated the safety of using glutamates as food additives. Until that time, no ADI (Acceptable Daily Intake) had been established. The EFSA calculated an ADI of 30 mg per kg of body weight per day for the six additives in that group. It also found that our dietary exposure to glutamates may exceed that safety limit, leading to adverse effects on humans for certain population groups. The EFSA\\'s expert panel therefore recommends a revision of the maximum levels of added glutamates in the food products that contribute most to exposure (fine bakery products, soups and broths, sauces, meat and meat-based products, seasonings and condiments, and dietary supplements)."

Its work revealed no effect of intense sweeteners on weight control. ANSES also recommends investigations of possible interactions among build, consumption of intense sweeteners, and weight gain. Moreover, some recent data suggest a link between consumption of sweeteners and weight gain. \\10\\10• Acesulfame potassium and diabetes\\10\\10Sweeteners may disrupt the intestinal flora and promote metabolic disorders, particularly glucose intolerance (a frequent step in developing type 2 diabetes). In addition, a study by the French National Institute for Health and Medical Research (INSERM) demonstrates that diet beverages are associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes.\\10\\10• Acesulfame potassium and cancer\\10\\10In 2005 the National Toxicology Program showed that there was no proof of carcinogenic activity in mice exposed to multiple doses of acesulfame potassium. Meanwhile, ANSES noted in 2015 that epidemiological studies on intense sweeteners demonstrated no effect on cancer in humans. Only one study, from 2012, suggests a link between the consumption of artificially sweetened beverages and the occurrence of non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma (cancer of the lymphatic system) and myeloma (bone marrow cancer) in humans.\\10\\10• Acesulfame potassium and premature birth\\10\\10A study conducted on pregnant women in Denmark reported a link between the consumption of artificially sweetened beverages and a risk of premature delivery. Another study, which followed over 60,000 pregnant women, suggested that consumption of both naturally and artificially sweetened beverages is linked to a heightened risk of spontaneous or induced premature delivery. \\10\\10\\10The European Union\\'s Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) re-evaluated the sweetener in 2000 and reaffirmed the absence of carcinogenic and mutagenic potential. However, the approval file was questioned by some researchers due to an absence of studies proving the sweetener\\'s harmlessness. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is currently conducting a safety re-evaluation, with a December 2020 deadline for publication of an opinion.\\10\\10In France, ANSES specified in its 2015 opinion that its work did not demonstrate any benefit to consumption of intense sweeteners on weight control, on blood sugar in diabetic subjects, or on the incidence of type 2 diabetes. It also indicated that its work did not establish any link showing increased risk of diabetes or cancer. However, it noted the need for new studies about the benefits and risks of sweeteners. In light of recent, incriminating studies, and while waiting for the EFSA\\'s forthcoming re-evaluation, we recommend limiting the consumption of foods or beverages containing acesulfame potassium.\\10"

It also indicated that its work did not establish any link showing increased risk of diabetes or cancer. However, it noted the need for new studies about the benefits and risks of sweeteners. \\10\\10Meanwhile, in its 2013 opinion, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) deemed aspartame safe for consumption at current levels of exposure. According to the EFSA, the current acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 40 mg per kg of body weight per day provides adequate protection for the general public. \\10\\10However, a study published in July 2019 by two researchers at the University of Sussex in the United Kingdom challenges the EFSA\\'s position. Indeed, the authors indicate that the EFSA excluded from its analysis 73 studies showing harmful effects of aspartame (brain damage, liver and lung cancers, neuroendocrine disorders), while most of the studies showing insufficient evidence were in fact included in the analysis. According to these researchers, the majority of the 73 rejected studies were more reliable than those showing no risks. The authors suggest that the EFSA may have been influenced by commercial or institutional conflicts of interest. They therefore call for an independent re-evaluation to be conducted in Europe.\\10\\10In light of recent, incriminating studies, and while waiting for the EFSA\\'s re-evaluation, we recommend limiting the consumption of beverages containing aspartame."
